Contributing to the Cenisys Project
===================================

Merge Requests are always welcome, and we appreciate any help you provided to improve Cenisys.

Please file Issues and Merge Requests on GitLab if possible. We use the GitLab flow to manage the development.

Trying to find a work?
----------------------

Here are some easy work recommendations:

- Completing source documentation
- Find a issue to fix, possibly with low weight

Issues
------

The issue tracker is only for bugs, not for support. Provide the following contents as more as possible for an issue:

- Step to reproduce
- The version and git hash
- Anything you tried to fix the problem

Style Guide
-----------

Any code should be formatted by clang-format, with the config file in the repository.
Try to make use of latest features of C++ and libraries.

Testing
-------

Every change must pass the test by the CI (continuous integration) service. We only merge if we have approvals by multiple developers.
